## Summary

In high school I enrolled in an engineering class where I had the opportunity to study at the Technopark by the RTU MIREA. There I worked on the development of an interactive website. Later I showcased my website project at the " The Engineers of the Future" conference. During my presentation, the jury was impressed by the design of my website and praised my special attention to details.

I independently mastered the English and German languages. Today I can proficiently read technical documentation, keep up with the latest news and engage in conversations in these languages. Proficiency in these languages also demonstrates my ability to successfully retain and use the information.

I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science". At the university  I do a lot of various assignments, labs and coursework related to the fields of mathematics and programming. Additionally I had the opportunity to take on the role of a class representative. This experience allowed me to become more responsible, disciplined and taught me how to interact with different people and find an approach to them.

I believe that my experience and ability to learn will lead me to an opportunity to become a Front-end Developer.
